# Create a SavingsAccount class which should inherit behavior from
# the Account class. It should include the following updated
# functionality:
#
# The initial balance cannot be less than $10. If it is, this will
# raise an ArgumentError
# Updated withdrawal functionality:
# Each withdrawal 'transaction' incurs a fee of $2 that is taken out
# of the balance.
# Does not allow the account to go below the $10 minimum balance
#- Will output a warning message and return the original un-modified
# balance
#It should include the following new method:
#add_interest(rate): Calculate the interest on the balance and add the
# interest to the balance. Return the interest that was calculated and
# added to the balance (not the updated balance).
# Input rate is assumed to be a percentage (i.e. 0.25).
# The formula for calculating interest is balance * rate/100
# Example: If the interest rate is 0.25% and the balance is $10,000,
# then the interest that is returned is $25 and the new balance becomes
# $10,025.
